## EDA 01 Univariate Analysis ##
Uni Means ONE. So Univariate Analysis is One Variable Analysis. Mainly in this part, we will deal with Numerical Measures. So in total we have 14 Numerical Measures

1. Measure of Central Tendency: 1. Mean 2. Median 3. Mode

2. Measure of Data Spread: 4. Quartile 5. Percentile 6. Range 7. IQR 8. Boxplot 9. Variance 10. Standard Deviation

3. Variation between Variables: 11. Covariance 12. Correlation Coefficient (Pearson and Spearman)

4. Measure Distribution and Peakness : 13. Skewness 14. Kurtosis

## EDA 04 Feature Engineering ##

Feature engineering is the process of selecting, manipulating and transforming raw data into features.

1. First is the Variable Transformation. For example, Log transformation Variable or Square Root transformation Variable. Scaling is also a type of Variable Transformation. For example, Min Max Scaler or Normalization and Standardization.
2. The Second is Feature Construction. For example, Binning.

## Clustering 01 Distance Metrics##

Distance Metrics in Machine Learning

1. Euclidean Distance: It represents the shortest distance between two points

2. Manhattan Distance: It is the sum of absolute differences between points across all the dimensions.

3. Minkowski Distance: Is the generalized form of Euclidean and Manhattan Distance. If P or Lamda = 1, then it calculates Manhatten Distance. If P or Lamda = 2, then it calculates Euclidean Distance. 

4. Hamming Distance: Hamming Distance measures the similarity between two strings of the same length. The Hamming Distance between two strings of the same length is the number of positions at which the corresponding characters are different.
