EDA 01 Univariate Analysis

Uni Means ONE. So Univariate Analysis is One Variable Analysis. Mainly in this part, we will deal with Numerical Measures. So in total we have 14 Numerical Measures

1. Measure of Central Tendency: 1. Mean 2. Median 3. Mode

2. Measure of Data Spread: 4. Quartile 5. Percentile 6. Range 7. IQR 8. Boxplot 9. Variance 10. Standard Deviation

3. Variation between Variables: 11. Covariance 12. Correlation Coefficient (Pearson and Spearman)

4. Measure Distribution and Peakness : 13. Skewness 14. Kurtosis
